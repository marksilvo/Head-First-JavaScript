var products = ["Choo Choo Chocolate", "Icy Mint", "Cake Batter", "Bubblegum"];
var last = products[products.length];
var recent = products[last];


Should have been
var products = ["Choo Choo Chocolate", "Icy Mint", "Cake Batter", "Bubblegum"];
var last = products.length - 1;
var recent = products[last];

array.length gives the number of items in the array

Indexes still begin at 0 so the index of the last item in the array is the length - 1
