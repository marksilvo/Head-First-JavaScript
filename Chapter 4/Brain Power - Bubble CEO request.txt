To get the list of scores I would use a while look using the array length.
Then reference the array index and the value at that index in the output

Array length can be used to count how many test there charset

Use if logic and a local variable to store the current maximum value and update it during each iteration
of the while loop to find the maximum value

Use if logic in the while loop to concatenate the index onto a string for the solution number if the value is the same
as the current max. If it is higher create a new string
