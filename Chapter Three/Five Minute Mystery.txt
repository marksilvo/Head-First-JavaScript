Balance is a global variable, the function steal uses a local variable of balance that shadows the global variable.

When steal is updating the balance it appears that the balance will decrease but it is only for the shadowing value,
not the global variable, so the balance never actually decreases

The return statement also appears below the "cameraOn = true" statement so the camera is left off
